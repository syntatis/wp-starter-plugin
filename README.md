This is a template or boilerplate you can use to start developing a WordPress plugin. The starter plugin provides an example of how to create a plugin with a settings page and a block.

It uses modern development tools like Composer, Webpack (via wp-scripts), PHPCS, PHPScoper, NPM, and ESLint. These tools are pre-configured to work together, allowing you to start developing your plugin right away without worrying about setup and configuration.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still in active development and the code is changing a lot, which might make it unstable. We donâ€™t recommend using it to develop a real plugin for your users yet. Please wait until the project is more stable.
