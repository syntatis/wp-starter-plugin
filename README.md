This WordPress plugin boilerplate is designed to be a starting point for your next plugin project, providing you with a foundation to build upon.

## Why?

Creating a WordPress plugin only requires a single PHP file, but as your plugin grows and require to integrate more differing features into it, you will need to organize your code in a way that makes it easier to manage and maintain.

The boilerplate sets up a basic structure for your plugin, including number of popular tools such as Composer and NPM to manage dependencies, Webpack to bundle assets, and PHPCS to lint PHP code to help you develop your plugin more efficiently
