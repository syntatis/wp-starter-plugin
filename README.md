This WordPress plugin boilerplate is designed to be a starting point for your next plugin project, providing you with a foundation to build upon.

## Why?

Creating a WordPress plugin can start with just a single PHP file, but as your plugin grows and adds more features, you'll need to organize your code and use the correct tools to make it easier to manage and maintain.

This WordPress boilerplate provides a basic structure for your plugin and includes some popular tools like [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage dependencies, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle assets, and [PHPCS](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to help you write clean, efficient code. This setup helps you get started quickly and develop your plugin more effectively.
