  <p>WordPress plugin boilerplate refined</p>
</div>

---

A WordPress plugin boilerplate to be used as a starter for your next plugin project. It provides an example of how to create a plugin with a settings page and a block. It uses modern development tools like [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (via [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/)), [PHPCS](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/), [PHPScoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). These tools are pre-configured to work together, allowing you to start developing your plugin right away without worrying about setup and configuration.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still in active development and the code is changing a lot, which might make it unstable. We don’t recommend using it to develop a real plugin for your users yet. Please wait until the project is more stable.
