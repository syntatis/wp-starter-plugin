## Why?

Creating a WordPress plugin can start with just a single PHP file, but as your plugin grows and adds more features, you'll need to organize your code and use the correct tools to make it easier to manage and maintain.

This WordPress boilerplate provides a minimal structure for your plugin and includes some popular tools pre-configureed to help you get started quickly and develop your plugin more effectively.

## Tools

Here are some of the tools included in this boilerplate:

* **[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**: To manage PHP dependencies.
* **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)**: To manage JavaScript dependencies.
* **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (via [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/))**: To bundle and optimize assets.
* **[PHPCS](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer)**: Check and fix code styles against some common practices in PHP.
* **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: Check and fix code styles against some common practices in JavaScript.
