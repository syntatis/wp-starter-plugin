## Why?

Creating a WordPress plugin can begin with just a single PHP file, but as your plugin grows and adds more features, you'll need to organize your code and use the right tools to make it easier to manage and maintain.

This WordPress boilerplate provides a basic structure for your plugin and includes some popular tools pre-configured to help you get started quickly and develop your plugin more efficiently.

## Tools

Here are some of the tools included in this boilerplate:

* **[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**: Manages PHP dependencies.
* **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)**: Manages JavaScript dependencies.
* **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (via [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/))**: Bundles and optimizes assets.
* **[PHPCS](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer)**: Checks and fixes code styles according to common PHP practices.
* **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: Checks and fixes code styles according to common JavaScript practices.
